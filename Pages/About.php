	Hi! I'm Michael Fuglsang, and welcome to my little corner of the internet.
	In my sparetime I enjoy playing video games, most recently League of Legends and Europa Universalis IV.
	Game of Thrones and Black Sails are some of my favorite TV series, and I also like cats and tortoises.
</p>
<p>
	I am currently studying for my Master's Degree in Computer Science at Aalborg University (AAU).
	I thrive when solving complex problems, one of the reasons for my fondness of Computer Science.
	I'm very result driven, and always looking to tackle problems head on, whether I'm working alone or as part of a team.
